%% Overview
% This example shows how to perform automatic detection and tracking of
% people in a video from a moving camera. It demonstrates the flexibility
% of a tracking system adapted to a moving camera, which is ideal for
% automotive safety applications. Unlike the stationary camera
% example, <motion-based-multiple-object-tracking.html The Motion-Based
% Multiple Object Tracking>, this example contains several additional 
% algorithmic steps. These steps include people detection, customized 
% non-maximum suppression, and heuristics to identify and eliminate false 
% alarm tracks. For more information please see 
% <docid:vision_ug#buq9qny-1 Multiple Object Tracking>.
%
% This example is a function with the main body at the top and helper 
% routines in the form of 
% <docid:matlab_prog#f4-39708 nested functions> 
% below.

%% Auxiliary Input and Global Parameters of the Tracking System
% This tracking system requires a data file that contains information that
% relates the pixel location in the image to the size of the bounding box
% marking the pedestrian's location. This prior knowledge is stored in a
% vector |pedScaleTable|. The n-th entry in |pedScaleTable| represents the
% estimated height of an adult person in pixels. The index |n| references
% the approximate Y-coordinate of the pedestrian's feet.
%
% To obtain such a vector, a collection of training images were taken from
% the same viewpoint and in a similar scene to the testing environment. The
% training images contained images of pedestrians at varying distances
% from the camera. Using the 
% <docid:vision_ref#mw_96fe579b-b33c-4798-a463-6fdeee7cd214 imageLabeler>
% app, bounding boxes of the pedestrians in the images were manually
% annotated. The height of the bounding boxes together with the location of
% the pedestrians in the image were used to generate the scale data file
% through regression. Here is a helper function to show the algorithmic steps to 
% fit the linear regression model:
% <matlab:edit(fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','vision','visiondemos','helperTableOfScales.m')) |helperTableOfScales.m|>   
%
%
% There is also a set of global parameters that can be tuned to optimize
% the tracking performance. You can use the descriptions below to learn
% about how these parameters affect the tracking performance.
%
% * |ROI| :                 Region-Of-Interest in the form of
%                           [x, y, w, h]. It limits the processing area to 
%                           ground locations.
% * |scThresh| :            Tolerance threshold for scale estimation.
%                           When the difference between the detected scale
%                           and the expected scale exceeds the tolerance,
%                           the candidate detection is considered to be
%                           unrealistic and is removed from the output.
% * |gatingThresh| :        Gating parameter for the distance measure. When
%                           the cost of matching the detected bounding box
%                           and the predicted bounding box exceeds the
%                           threshold, the system removes the association
%                           of the two bounding boxes from tracking
%                           consideration.
% * |gatingCost| :          Value for the assignment cost matrix to
%                           discourage the possible tracking to detection 
%                           assignment.
% * |costOfNonAssignment| : Value for the assignment cost matrix for
%                           not assigning a detection or a track. Setting 
%                           it too low increases the likelihood of
%                           creating a new track, and may result in track 
%                           fragmentation. Setting it too high may result 
%                           in a single track corresponding to a series of
%                           separate moving objects.
% * |timeWindowSize| :      Number of frames required to estimate the
%                           confidence of the track.
% * |confidenceThresh| :    Confidence threshold to determine if the
%                           track is a true positive.
% * |ageThresh| :           Minimum length of a track being a true positive.
% * |visThresh| :           Minimum visibility threshold to determine if
%                           the track is a true positive.


%% Create System Objects for the Tracking System Initialization 
% The |setupSystemObjects| function creates system objects used for reading
% and displaying the video frames and loads the scale data file.
%
% The |pedScaleTable| vector, which is stored in the scale data file,
% encodes our prior knowledge of the target and the scene. Once you have the
% regressor trained from your samples, you can compute the expected height
% at every possible Y-position in the image. These values are stored in the
% vector. The n-th entry in |pedScaleTable| represents our estimated height 
% of an adult person in pixels. The index |n| references the approximate
% Y-coordinate of the pedestrian's feet.

    function obj = setupSystemObjects(videoFile,scaleDataFile)
        % Initialize Video I/O
        % Create objects for reading a video from a file, drawing the 
        % detected and tracked people in each frame, and playing the video.
        
        % Create a video file reader.
        obj.reader = VideoReader(videoFile);
        
        % Create a video player.
        obj.videoPlayer = vision.VideoPlayer('Position', [29, 597, 643, 386]);                
        
        % Load the scale data file                                        
        ld = load(scaleDataFile, 'pedScaleTable');
        obj.pedScaleTable = ld.pedScaleTable;
    end


%% Initialize Tracks
% The |initializeTracks| function creates an array of tracks, where each
% track is a structure representing a moving object in the video. The
% purpose of the structure is to maintain the state of a tracked object.
% The state consists of information used for detection-to-track assignment,
% track termination, and display. 
%
% The structure contains the following fields:
%
% * |id| :                  An integer ID of the track.
% * |color| :               The color of the track for display purpose.
% * |bboxes| :              A N-by-4 matrix to represent the bounding boxes 
%                           of the object with the current box at the last
%                           row. Each row has a form of [x, y, width,
%                           height].
% * |scores| :              An N-by-1 vector to record the classification
%                           score from the person detector with the current
%                           detection score at the last row.
% * |kalmanFilter| :        A Kalman filter object used for motion-based
%                           tracking. We track the center point of the
%                           object in image;
% * |age| :                 The number of frames since the track was
%                           initialized.
% * |totalVisibleCount| :   The total number of frames in which the object
%                           was detected (visible).
% * |confidence| :          A pair of two numbers to represent how
%                           confident we trust the track. It stores the 
%                           maximum and the average detection scores in the
%                           past within a predefined time window.
% * |predPosition| :        The predicted bounding box in the next frame.

    function tracks = initializeTracks()
        % Create an empty array of tracks
        tracks = struct(...
            'id', {}, ...
            'color', {}, ...
            'bboxes', {}, ...
            'scores', {}, ...

    end

%% Detect People
% The |detectPeople| function returns the centroids, the bounding boxes,
% and the classification scores of the detected people. It performs
% filtering and non-maximum suppression on the raw output of the detector
% returned by |peopleDetectorACF|.
%
% * |centroids| :         An N-by-2 matrix with each row in the form of
%                         [x,y].
% * |bboxes| :            An N-by-4 matrix with each row in the form of
%                         [x, y, width, height].
% * |scores| :            An N-by-1 vector with each element is the
%                         classification score at the corresponding frame.

    function [centroids, bboxes, scores] = detectPeople()
        % Resize the image to increase the resolution of the pedestrian.
        % This helps detect people further away from the camera.
        resizeRatio = 1.5;
        frame = imresize(frame, resizeRatio, 'Antialiasing',false);
        
        % Run ACF people detector within a region of interest to produce
        % detection candidates.
        [bboxes, scores] = detect(detector, frame, option.ROI, ...
            'WindowStride', 2,...
            'NumScaleLevels', 4, ...

        % Remove detections whose size deviates from the expected size, 
        % provided by the calibrated scale estimation. 
        invalid = abs(estHeight-height)>estHeight*option.scThresh;        
        bboxes(invalid, :) = [];
        scores(invalid, :) = [];

        % Apply non-maximum suppression to select the strongest bounding boxes.
        [bboxes, scores] = selectStrongestBbox(bboxes, scores, ...
                            'RatioType', 'Min', 'OverlapThreshold', 0.6);                               
        
        % Compute the centroids
        if isempty(bboxes)
            centroids = [];

                (bboxes(:, 2) + bboxes(:, 4) / 2)];
        end
    end

%% Predict New Locations of Existing Tracks
% Use the Kalman filter to predict the centroid of each track in the
% current frame, and update its bounding box accordingly. We take the width
% and height of the bounding box in previous frame as our current
% prediction of the size.

    function predictNewLocationsOfTracks()
        for i = 1:length(tracks)
            % Get the last bounding box on this track.
            bbox = tracks(i).bboxes(end, :);
            
            % Predict the current location of the track.
            predictedCentroid = predict(tracks(i).kalmanFilter);
            
            % Shift the bounding box so that its center is at the predicted location.
            tracks(i).predPosition = [predictedCentroid - bbox(3:4)/2, bbox(3:4)];
        end
    end

%% Assign Detections to Tracks
% Assigning object detections in the current frame to existing tracks is
% done by minimizing cost. The cost is computed using the |bboxOverlapRatio| 
% function, and is the overlap ratio between the predicted bounding box and 
% the detected bounding box. In this example, we assume the person will move 
% gradually in consecutive frames due to the high frame rate of the video 
% and the low motion speed of a person.
%
% The algorithm involves two steps: 
%
% Step 1: Compute the cost of assigning every detection to each track using
% the |bboxOverlapRatio| measure. As people move towards or away from the
% camera, their motion will not be accurately described by the centroid
% point alone. The cost takes into account the distance on the image plane as
% well as the scale of the bounding boxes. This prevents assigning
% detections far away from the camera to tracks closer to the
% camera, even if their centroids coincide. The choice of this cost function
% will ease the computation without resorting to a more sophisticated
% dynamic model. The results
% are stored in an MxN matrix, where M is the number of tracks, and N is
% the number of detections.
%
% Step 2: Solve the assignment problem represented by the cost matrix using
% the |assignDetectionsToTracks| function. The function takes the cost
% matrix and the cost of not assigning any detections to a track.
%
% The value for the cost of not assigning a detection to a track depends on
% the range of values returned by the cost function. This value must be
% tuned experimentally. Setting it too low increases the likelihood of
% creating a new track, and may result in track fragmentation. Setting it
% too high may result in a single track corresponding to a series of
% separate moving objects.
%
% The |assignDetectionsToTracks| function uses the Munkres' version of the
% Hungarian algorithm to compute an assignment which minimizes the total
% cost. It returns an M x 2 matrix containing the corresponding indices of
% assigned tracks and detections in its two columns. It also returns the
% indices of tracks and detections that remained unassigned.

    function [assignments, unassignedTracks, unassignedDetections] = ...
            detectionToTrackAssignment()
        
        % Compute the overlap ratio between the predicted boxes and the
        % detected boxes, and compute the cost of assigning each detection
        % to each track. The cost is minimum when the predicted bbox is
        % perfectly aligned with the detected bbox (overlap ratio is one)
        predBboxes = reshape([tracks(:).predPosition], 4, [])';
        cost = 1 - bboxOverlapRatio(predBboxes, bboxes);

        % Force the optimization step to ignore some matches by
        % setting the associated cost to be a large number. Note that this
        % number is different from the 'costOfNonAssignment' below.
        % This is useful when gating (removing unrealistic matches)
        % technique is applied.
        cost(cost > option.gatingThresh) = 1 + option.gatingCost;

        [assignments, unassignedTracks, unassignedDetections] = ...
            assignDetectionsToTracks(cost, option.costOfNonAssignment);
    end

%% Update Assigned Tracks
% The |updateAssignedTracks| function updates each assigned track with the
% corresponding detection. It calls the |correct| method of
% |vision.KalmanFilter| to correct the location estimate. Next, it stores
% the new bounding box by taking the average of the size of recent (up to) 
% 4 boxes, and increases the age of the track and the total visible count 
% by 1. Finally, the function adjusts our confidence score for the track 
% based on the previous detection scores. 

    function updateAssignedTracks()
        numAssignedTracks = size(assignments, 1);
        for i = 1:numAssignedTracks
            trackIdx = assignments(i, 1);
            detectionIdx = assignments(i, 2);

            centroid = centroids(detectionIdx, :);
            bbox = bboxes(detectionIdx, :);
            
            % Correct the estimate of the object's location
            % using the new detection.
            correct(tracks(trackIdx).kalmanFilter, centroid);
            
            % Stabilize the bounding box by taking the average of the size 
            % of recent (up to) 4 boxes on the track. 
            T = min(size(tracks(trackIdx).bboxes,1), 4);
            w = mean([tracks(trackIdx).bboxes(end-T+1:end, 3); bbox(3)]);
            h = mean([tracks(trackIdx).bboxes(end-T+1:end, 4); bbox(4)]);
            tracks(trackIdx).bboxes(end+1, :) = [centroid - [w, h]/2, w, h];
            
            % Update track's age.
            tracks(trackIdx).age = tracks(trackIdx).age + 1;
            
            % Update track's score history
            tracks(trackIdx).scores = [tracks(trackIdx).scores; scores(detectionIdx)];
            
            % Update visibility.
            tracks(trackIdx).totalVisibleCount = ...
                tracks(trackIdx).totalVisibleCount + 1;
            
            % Adjust track confidence score based on the maximum detection
            % score in the past 'timeWindowSize' frames.

            tracks(trackIdx).confidence = [max(score), mean(score)];
        end
    end

%% Update Unassigned Tracks
% The |updateUnassignedTracks| function marks each unassigned track as 
% invisible, increases its age by 1, and appends the predicted bounding box 
% to the track. The confidence is set to zero since we are not sure why it
% was not assigned to a track.

    function updateUnassignedTracks()
        for i = 1:length(unassignedTracks)
            idx = unassignedTracks(i);
            tracks(idx).age = tracks(idx).age + 1;
            tracks(idx).bboxes = [tracks(idx).bboxes; tracks(idx).predPosition];
            tracks(idx).scores = [tracks(idx).scores; 0];
            
            % Adjust track confidence score based on the maximum detection
            % score in the past 'timeWindowSize' frames
            T = min(option.timeWindowSize, length(tracks(idx).scores));
            score = tracks(idx).scores(end-T+1:end);
            tracks(idx).confidence = [max(score), mean(score)];
        end
    end

%% Delete Lost Tracks
% The |deleteLostTracks| function deletes tracks that have been invisible
% for too many consecutive frames. It also deletes recently created tracks
% that have been invisible for many frames overall.
% 
% Noisy detections tend to result in creation of false tracks. For this
% example, we remove a track under following conditions:
%
% * The object was tracked for a short time. This typically happens when a 
%   false detection shows up for a few frames and a track was initiated for it. 
% * The track was marked invisible for most of the frames. 
% * It failed to receive a strong detection within the past few frames, 
%   which is expressed as the maximum detection confidence score.

    function deleteLostTracks()
        if isempty(tracks)
            return;
        end        
        
        % Compute the fraction of the track's age for which it was visible.
        ages = [tracks(:).age]';
        totalVisibleCounts = [tracks(:).totalVisibleCount]';
        visibility = totalVisibleCounts ./ ages;
        
        % Check the maximum detection confidence score.
        confidence = reshape([tracks(:).confidence], 2, [])';
        maxConfidence = confidence(:, 1);

        % Find the indices of 'lost' tracks.
        lostInds = (ages <= option.ageThresh & visibility <= option.visThresh) | ...
             (maxConfidence <= option.confidenceThresh);

        % Delete lost tracks.
        tracks = tracks(~lostInds);
    end

%% Create New Tracks
% Create new tracks from unassigned detections. Assume that any unassigned
% detection is a start of a new track. In practice, you can use other cues
% to eliminate noisy detections, such as size, location, or appearance.
